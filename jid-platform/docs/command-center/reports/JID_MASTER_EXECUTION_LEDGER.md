# JID Master Execution Ledger

## Specification 03 — Entity Rejection / Reapply Journey

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| specification | 03 |
| status | IN_PROGRESS |
| session | 03-B (Session 03-A complete) |
| Session A base SHA | ed5bc4048733a654b72d544b38248e3854481540 |
| Session A source branch | cursor/jid-03a-baseline-reconciliation |
| Spec 02 gate | SHIPPED at tip `ed5bc4048733a654b72d544b38248e3854481540` (required before Spec 03) |
| duplicate_prevention_gap | false |
| duplicate_prevention_gap evidence | BEFORE INSERT trigger `enforce_verification_request_applicant_insert_boundary` (migration `20260720072615_harden_verification_request_insert_boundary.sql`) raises `active_verification_request_exists` when the same authenticated applicant already has any row in pending/submitted/pending_review/under_review/needs_more_info (applicant-scoped; covers same-user+same-directory duplicates). RLS suite `verification-insert-boundary.rls.test.ts` asserts the duplicate insert is denied. App-layer `submitClaimRequest` only pre-checks reapply cooldown (no active-duplicate pre-check); the DB trigger remains the authoritative race-safe boundary. |
| Session A verified files | Business: `company/verification-pending`, `company/verification-rejected` (links `/company/verification/reapply`), `company/verification/reapply` (ClaimSubmissionForm). University: `university/pending-review`, `university/rejected` (CTA links `/signup/university` — **no** `university/.../reapply` route). Helpers: `rejected-claim.ts` (`getLatestRejectedVerification`, `canReapplyNow`, `formatRequiredDocuments`); `claims.ts` `submitClaimRequest`. Messages: `entity.rejected` EN+AR key parity. Migration: `20260720072615_harden_verification_request_insert_boundary.sql`. |

### Session 03-A scope (complete)
- Baseline reconciliation against Spec 02 SHIPPED tip `ed5bc40`.
- Verified starting-state routes/helpers/messages and insert-boundary migration.
- Recorded `duplicate_prevention_gap: false` with trigger + RLS-test + application-path evidence (no product fix; no university reapply route built — deferred to Session B).

### Session 03-B scope (this commit)
- University `/university/reapply` route reusing rejected-claim helpers (Business behavior, university flat naming).
- Spec 03 §8 state-resolution shared helper + organization-profile / pending-page alignment; `needs_more_info` honest awaiting copy.
- Explicit approved-without-profile notice (no auto-creation) on both create-profile pages.
- Terminology + `noReason` fallback; AR/EN parity tests under `tests/unit/entity/**`.
- No RLS, RPC, schema, or duplicate-prevention changes.

### Still deferred (Specification 03)
- Duplicate-prevention fix (Session C, only if gap were true — not required given Session A finding = false)
- Needs-more-info respond flow; evidence upload; Spec 06 notifications; Spec 08 visual redesign
